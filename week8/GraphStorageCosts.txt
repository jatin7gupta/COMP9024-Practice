a.
AM stores elements as ints hence
it will store all the verties*vertices 2d array
so 
V*V*4 + 8*V for the pointers to the each row, is the value of the memory used for storing the AM version

b.
8*V for pointers to vertices
for each edge, (4+8)
and for each edge you store 2 times
so 8*V + 2*12*E

c.
100*100*4 + 8*100 AM

8*100 + 12*2*E = AL
equating both the sides
100*100*4 + 8*100 = 8*100 + 12*2*E
100*100/6 = E
~1667 = E
if E is greater than 1667 then only AM is better choice than AL
